We are building an application (LLM API caller wrapped into UI and boosted) that does the following:

**Context manager about data from different sources**

2. Communication tools  (Slack, Teams conversations)
3. BI tools (Metabase database)
4. Data terms (Datahub, Atlan and others data catalogs)
5. TBD

Store this somewhere to make it more token friendly?

**Tools manager to be used while LLM conversation**

1. Create SQL
2. Query DB
3. Visualise data (single chart, multiple charts)
4. Analyse data
5. TBD
